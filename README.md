# Welcome!

## What is Hedgehogs?

Welcome to HedgeHogs, a sophisticated DeFi automation platform that empowers you to manage complex, automated strategies across multiple protocols like Aave v3 and Uniswap v3.

Our mission is to simplify advanced DeFi strategies, making it easier for you to protect your assets, optimize your yield, and manage your positions with less manual effort. Using a unique proxy-based architecture, HedgeHogs provides a seamless and unified interface for all your DeFi activities.



## Key Features

* **Gas Efficiency:** Our smart contracts are optimized for gas savings, including multicall support to batch multiple actions into a single transaction.
