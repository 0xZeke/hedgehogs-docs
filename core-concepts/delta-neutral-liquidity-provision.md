# Delta-Neutral Liquidity Provision

Now that we've covered hedging both the upside and downside, we can combine them to create a delta-neutral strategy.

A delta-neutral position means you are not exposed to ETH price movementsâ€”you make money from trading fees regardless of whether ETH moves up or down.

* **How?** By properly sizing your long and short positions while providing liquidity.
* **Goal:** Stay inside the range to earn fees while ensuring your total ETH exposure remains balanced.
* **Outcome:** You mitigate impermanent loss and profit from market volatility instead of being affected by it.
