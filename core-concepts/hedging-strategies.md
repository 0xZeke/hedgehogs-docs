# Hedging Strategies

Now, let's look at what happens when ETH rises past the upper boundary with a loan to protect a bullish ETH position.&#x20;

## **Hedging Against Price Increases**

#### **Initial Setup**

Instead of using your own ETH and USDC to provide liquidity, you:

1. Deposit ETH as collateral in a lending protocol.
2. Borrow USDC against it.
3. Swap half the USDC for ETH.
4. Provide liquidity to the ETH/USDC pool in the $1,500 – $2,500 range.

#### **What Happens as ETH Moves Toward $2,500?**

* **Without a Hedge:** As ETH rises, the pool reduces your ETH holdings and gives you more USDC instead. If ETH pumps past $2,500, you are left only with USDC—meaning you've lost ETH exposure and missed out on additional gains.
* **With the Hedge:** The LP position still shifts toward USDC, but your borrowed ETH ensures your total ETH exposure stays the same. You're protected even if ETH goes beyond $2,500, because you still hold 1 ETH as part of the original loan.

## **Hedging Against Price Decreases**

Let's say you provided liquidity in the $1,500 - $2,500 range. If ETH drops below $1,500, your position becomes 100% ETH, and you stop earning trading fees.

* **Risk:** If ETH keeps falling, you are now fully exposed to price declines.
* **Without a Hedge:** You start accumulating more ETH but have no protection if ETH continues to drop.
* **With a Hedge:** Instead of only borrowing USDC, you also borrow ETH.This allows you to short ETH while providing liquidity, offsetting potential losses. If ETH falls, your short position gains value, balancing out your LP losses.
