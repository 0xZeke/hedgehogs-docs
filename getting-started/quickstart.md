## **ðŸš€ HedgeHogs in 5 Minutes: Quickstart Guide**

Get your first automated position up and running in just a few steps.

### **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**

Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner of the application and approve the connection in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

### **Step 2: Create Your HedgeHogs Proxy**

To use HedgeHogs, you first need to deploy your personal proxy contract. This contract is your secure vault that will manage all your DeFi positions.

* Navigate to the "Dashboard".
* Click **"Create Proxy"** and approve the transaction in your wallet.

This is a one-time setup. Once your proxy is created, you're ready to interact with any supported protocol through the HedgeHogs interface.

### **Step 3: Make Your First Deposit**

Let's start by supplying some collateral to Aave.

* In the dashboard, find the Aave v3 module and click **"Supply"**.
* Choose the asset you want to supply (e.g., ETH) and the amount.
* Approve and confirm the transaction.

Your deposit will now appear as a "Supply Position" in your HedgeHogs dashboard.

### **Step 4: Configure Your First Automation**

Now, let's put your assets to work.

* Find your new Supply Position in the dashboard and click **"Manage"**.
* Go to the **"Automation"** tab.
* Let's set up a simple **Auto-Harvest** or **Auto-Collateralize** strategy. Select the strategy, configure the settings, and click **"Activate"**.

That's it! Your HedgeHogs bot will now monitor your position and automatically execute your chosen strategy according to your rules.
