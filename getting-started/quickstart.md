# Quickstart

## **ðŸš€ HedgeHogs in 5 Minutes: Quickstart Guide**

Get your first automated position up and running in just a few steps.

#### **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**

Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top-right corner of the application and approve the connection in your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

#### **Step 2: Create Your HedgeHogs Proxy**

To use HedgeHogs, you first need to deploy your personal proxy contract. This contract is your secure vault that will manage all your DeFi positions.

* Navigate to the "Dashboard".
* Click **"Create Proxy"** and approve the transaction in your wallet.

This is a one-time setup. Once your proxy is created, you're ready to interact with any supported protocol through the HedgeHogs interface.

#### **Step 3: Make Your First Deposit**

Let's start by supplying some collateral to Aave.

* In the dashboard, find the Aave v3 module and click **"Supply"**.
* Choose the asset you want to supply (e.g., ETH) and the amount.
* Approve and confirm the transaction.

Your deposit will now appear as a "Supply Position" in your HedgeHogs dashboard.

#### **Step 4: Configure Your First Automation**

Now, let's put your assets to work.

* Find your new Supply Position in the dashboard and click **"Manage"**.
* Go to the **"Automation"** tab.
* Let's set up a simple **Auto-Harvest** or **Auto-Collateralize** strategy. Select the strategy, configure the settings, and click **"Activate"**.

That's it! Your HedgeHogs bot will now monitor your position and automatically execute your chosen strategy according to your rules.

### Sync a repository

GitBook also allows you to set up a bi-directional sync with an existing repository on GitHub or GitLab. Setting up Git Sync allows you and your team to write content in GitBook or in code, and never have to worry about your content becoming out of sync.
